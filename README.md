# OpenSCAD-braille-generator
This is a grade one Universal English Braille (UEB) generator script for use in OpenSCAD.  This takes up to four lines of character input and generates braille glyphs for them with a back plate.  The script includes logic to check for numerals, upper case characters, and closing quotes.  It should be fairly easy to adapt this to other languages, as it is based on character codes.  The character ascii codes are mapped to a mapping for the braille glyph.  This will handle characters that use up to three glyphs, which was the maximum I saw.  File braille_generator.scad is the final version of the script.  Images of the output can be found at my Printables page: https://www.printables.com/model/496436-grade-one-braille-generator.
